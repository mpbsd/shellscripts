# Shell Scripts

I created these shell scripts to:

- Make repetitive tasks a little less boring
- Reduce typos on the command line
- Speed up things a little bit
- Not forget solutions to problems that I've already dealt with in the past
- Share these solutions with others
- Have fun ;)

Also, I should mention that I manage them with [GNU/Stow][].
